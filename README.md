# http-server

We propose to use this as the server environment for the application.  It is a lightweight application built in Javascript.

To install it, issue the command ```npm install http-server -g```.  
This will allow the app to be run from the command line.

When the program is launched it will default to ./ as the working directory unless ./public exists.   

For a list of command line options, issue  ```http-server -h```
